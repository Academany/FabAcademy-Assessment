# General essentials

1. Design files and code must be present in the archive and in the original editable format  (antimony, solidworks, eagle, CAD, etc).

2. Externally host your large files (+1MB) and link to them (discuss with instructor first).

3. Minor changes will be made to this document during Fab Academy, but additions to assessment requirements will only be made to future assignments, not completed assignments.

4. Acknowledge work done by others.

5. Take photos, notes and screenshots as you work - compress and resize your images for web. Use these to explain and describe what you do. A ‘hero shot’ is the best photo showing your finished project.

6. All weekly modules must be completed before you are considered for Final Evaluation.

7. Follow the Commercial Board Policy

8. Final project must meet the basic requirements outlined at the end of this doc.

> Imagine that one day you need to reproduce all of your assignments. You have no internet (except fab modules), no-one is able to help you. You have only your fab academy archive folder and the resources of the fab lab. Ensure that you have documented everything in enough detail in your archive so that you can do this easily.
