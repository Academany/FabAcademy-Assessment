# Embedded Programming
* Read a microcontroller [data sheet](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/doc8183.pdf).
* Program your [board](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html) to do something, with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible.


## Learning outcomes:
* Identify relevant information in a microcontroller data sheet.

* Implement programming protocols.

## Have you:
* Documented what you learned from reading a microcontroller datasheet.

* What questions do you have? What would you like to learn more about?

* Programmed your board

* Described the programming process/es you used

* Included your code
