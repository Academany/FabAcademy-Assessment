## **INTERFACE AND APPLICATION PROGRAMMING **

## Write an application that interfaces with an[ input](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/input_devices/index.html) &/or[ output](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/output_devices/index.html) device that you made* * *


## Learning outcomes:

* Interpret and implement programming protocols

**Have you:**

* Described your process using words/images/screenshots.  

* Explained the protocols you used

* Had a fun time

* Outlined problems and how you fixed them

* Included original code

## * * *


## APPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

## Propose a final project that integrates a range of units covered. Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the skills. Where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project.

## * * *


## Learning outcomes:

* Define the scope of a project

* Develop a project plan

Think of your project plan as an ‘installation and implementation guide’ for the future.

How will others be able to make your project by reading your documentation?

**Have you answered these questions:**

* what will it do?

* who has done what beforehand?

* what materials and components will be required?

* where will they come from?

* how much will it cost?

The answers to the questions above will become your BOM, or Bill Of Materials.

* what parts and systems will be made?

* what processes will be used?

* what tasks need to be completed?

* what questions need to be answered?

* what is the schedule?

* how will it be evaluated?

## * * *


## **INVENTION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND BUSINESS MODELS**

## Create and document a license for your final project. Develop a plan for dissemination of your[ final project](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/applications_implications/index.html)* * *


## Learning outcomes:

* Recognise the range of licenses available

* Formulate future opportunities

**Have you:**

* Summarised two kinds of licences and explained why you chose one.

* Dreamed of possibilities and described how to make them probabilities

## * * *


## **PROJECT DEVELOPMENT **

## Complete your final project. Track and document your progress. Create a final project slide in the archive according to the specifications provided.* * *


## Learning outcomes:

* Evaluate project plan

* Apply time management techniques

* Summarise and communicate the essence of a project

**Have you answered these questions:**

* what is the deadline? How much time do I have left?

* what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain?

* how will I complete the remaining tasks in time?

* what has worked?

* what hasn't?

* what questions still need to be resolved?

* what have you learned?

**Have you made a separate ‘Final Project’ page that briefly summarises your project and**

* includes the BOM (Bill of Materials) for your project

* links to any weeks that you worked on your final project

* links to your presentation.png and presentation.mp4

* includes all of your design files in the archive (no external hosting of final project files - discuss file sizes with your instructor)

* Includes the licence you chose

**Have you made your presentation.png (slide: 1280 x 1024 resolution) and included:**

* your name

* the name of your project

* the name of the Fab Lab

* photo/render/sketch of your project

* a brief description of what your project is/does

**Have you: **

* made a ~1 minute (10MB/1080p) video of you explaining your project
