# Computer-Aided Design
* Model (draw, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible[ final project](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/people/), and post it on your class page with original 2D and 3D files.

Don't rely on a printed document. As you work, check the information for each assignment in this living document each week. 

## Learning outcomes:
* Evaluate and select 2D and 3D software

* Demonstrate and describe processes used in modelling with 2D and 3D software

## Have you:
* Modelled experimental objects/part of a possible project in 2D and 3D software

* Shown how you did it with words/images/screenshots

* Included your original design files
