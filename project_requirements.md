> Congratulations, you have now reached the point of working on your Final Project. This is the opportunity to demonstrate synthesis of skills you have developed in the previous weeks. Your goal is to keep it as affordable as possible. Design and fabricate your own parts instead of buying off-the-shelf components. Each student, whether working individually or in a group, must prove mastery of the skills gained during the program.

## Learning Outcomes:
* demonstrate 2D & 3D modelling capabilities applied to your own designs
* select and apply appropriate additive and subtractive techniques
* demonstrate competence in design, fabrication and programming of your own fabbed microcontroller PCB, including and input & output device


## Have you made a separate *Final Project* page that:
* briefly summarises your project

* includes the BOM (Bill of Materials) for your project

* links to any weeks that you worked on your final project

* links to your presentation.png and presentation.mp4

* includes all of your design files in the archive (2D & 3D, board files & code) No external hosting of final project files - discuss file sizes with your instructor

* includes the licence you chose

* acknowledges work done by others

## Have you made your slide:
* slide: 1280 x 1024 pixels named presentation.png

* your name

* the name of your project

* the name of the Fab Lab

* photo/render/sketch of your project

* a brief description of what your project is/does

## Have you made your video:
* made a ~1 minute (10MB/1080p/720p) video of you explaining your project

## FAQ:

### Can I just design a shield for a commercial board in my final project?
> Answer:
1. No. Please check the final project requirements above.

### Can I use the satshakit/fabduino for my final project?
> Answer:
1. You have to design your own board(s).
2. You can use it to program your own input/output devices. Fabricating an unmodified board is considered as electronics production but does not count towards any design skill.

### My final projects electronics is a tangle of wires but it works. So I guess this is it.
> Answer:
1. No. Your final project must show integration of the skills beyond early stage prototyping. That includes arranging the wiring, use of connectors, etc.

### How do we present a Group Project?
> Answer:
1. Each student will make a specific slide that shows it's a group project (names the project and the other collaborator/s) and details the parts developed by the individual
2. Each student will make a specific video that will have some shared content, but mainly shows the parts developed by the individual
