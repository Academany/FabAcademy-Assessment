# Embedded Networking and Communications
Design and build a wired &/or wireless network connecting at least two processors

> ### Issue opened.
Networking needs to be more clearly defined here. Like expressing the need to have multiple controllers communicating using addressing.

## Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate workflows used in network design and construction

* Implement and interpret networking protocols

## Have you:
* Described your design and fabrication process using words/images/screenshots.  

* Explained the programming process/es you used.

* Outlined problems and how you fixed them

* Included original design files and code

## FAQ:

### Can we use arduino/commercial boards for networking?
> Answer:
1. It depends on the case: you can use commercial boards for wireless devices. But you canâ€™t use Arduino or similar commercial microcontroller boards because they can be made in the fab lab. For this week, you can use the original satcha-kit/fab-kit/fabduino.

### Must each board have a unique identity?
> Answer:
1. It does not have to be hard-coded but you must use some form of addressing.
