# Embedded Networking and Communications
Design and build a wired &/or wireless network connecting at least two processors

> Networking needs to be more clearly defined here. Like expressing the need to have multiple controllers communicating using addressing.

## Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate workflows used in network design and construction

* Implement and interpret networking protocols

## Have you:
* Described your design and fabrication process using words/images/screenshots.  

* Explained the programming process/es you used.

* Outlined problems and how you fixed them

* Included original design files and code
