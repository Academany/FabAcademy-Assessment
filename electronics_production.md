> As outlined in the Commercial Boards policy, fabbing your own boards is an important part of Fab Academy. The cleanest and the 'fabbest' way to do this, is by milling your FR1 boards via Fab Modules or Mods. Although you can experiment with other ways, they will not be the default manufacturing method during Fab Academy.  

# Electronics Production
* Make the Fab (tiny)ISP in-circuit programmer. 

* Optionally, make your own FTDI cable.

## Learning outcomes:
* Describe the process of milling, stuffing, de-bugging and programming

* Demonstrate correct workflows and identify areas for improvement if required

## Have you:
* Shown how you made and programmed the board

* Explained any problems and how you fixed them

* Included a ‘hero shot’ of your board
