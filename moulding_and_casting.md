# Moulding and Casting
Design a 3D mould, machine it, and cast parts from it.

## Learning outcomes:
* Design appropriate objects within the limitations of 3 axis machining

* Demonstrate workflows used in mould design, construction and casting

## Have you:
* Explained how you made your files for machining

* Shown how you made your mould and cast the parts

* Been surprised today

* Described problems and how you fixed them

* Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the mould and the final object
