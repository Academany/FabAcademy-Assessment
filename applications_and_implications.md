# Applications and Implications
Propose a final project that integrates a range of units covered. Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the skills. Where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project.

## Learning outcomes:
* Define the scope of a project

* Develop a project plan

> Think of your project plan as an ‘installation and implementation guide’ for the future. How will others be able to make your project by reading your documentation?

## Have you answered these questions:
* what will it do?

* who has done what beforehand?

* what materials and components will be required?

* where will they come from?

* how much will it cost?

The answers to the questions above will allow you to create your BOM, or Bill Of Materials.

* what parts and systems will be made?

* what processes will be used?

* what tasks need to be completed?

* what questions need to be answered?

* what is the schedule?

* how will it be evaluated?
