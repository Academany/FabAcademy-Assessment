# Computer-Controlled Machining
Make something [big](http://blog.ted.com/2008/07/15/digitally_fabbe/) (on a CNC machine).

Don't rely on a printed document. As you work, check the information for each assignment in this living document each week. 

## Learning outcomes:
* Document the process of design and production to demonstrate correct workflows and identify areas for improvement if needed

## Have you:
* Explained how you made your files for machining (2D or 3D)

* Shown how you made something BIG (setting up the machine, using fixings, testing joints, adjusting feeds and speeds, depth of cut etc)

* Described problems and how you fixed them

* Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of final object
