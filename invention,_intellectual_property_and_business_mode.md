## FAQ:

### What does 'summarised two kinds of licence' mean?
> Answer:
1. To show that you understand Neil's lecture, and what your licence is for, you need to compare licences so that you can choose the correct one for you.
2. You can compare two kinds of Open Licences, or compare two options for one kind of Open Licence. Or more...two is the minimum.
