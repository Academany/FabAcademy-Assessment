# Input Devices

Measure something: add a sensor to a microcontroller board that you have designed and read it.

## Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate workflows used in circuit board design and fabrication

* Implement and interpret programming protocols

## Have you:
* Described your design and fabrication process using words/images/screenshots.  

* Explained the programming process/es you used and how the microcontroller datasheet helped you.

* Explained problems and how you fixed them

* Included original design files and code

## FAQ:

### Is the satsha kit/fabduino I fabricated considered a valid board for this assignment?
> Answer:
1. Fabricating an unmodified board is considered as electronics production but does not count towards any design skill.
2. If you changed the original satsha kit/fabduino, it is a valid board.
