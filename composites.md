# Composites
Design and make a 3D mould (~ft2 /30x30cm), and produce a fibre composite part in it

## Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate workflows used in mould design and construction

* Select and apply suitable materials and processes to create a composite part.

## Have you:
* Shown how you made your mould and created the composite

* Described problems and how you fixed them

* Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the mould and the final part

* Read and linked to the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and technical data sheet (TDS) for the resins that you're using
