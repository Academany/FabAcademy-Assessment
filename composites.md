# Composites
Read the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and technical data sheet (TDS) for the resins that you're using

Design and make a 3D mould (~ft2 /30x30cm), and produce a fibre composite part in it

## Learning outcomes:
* Demonstrate workflows used in mould design and construction

* Select and apply suitable materials and processes to create a composite part.

## Have you:
* Shown how you made your mould and created the composite

* Described problems and how you fixed them

* Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the mould and the final part

* Read and linked to the material safety data sheet (MSDS) and technical data sheet (TDS) for the resins that you're using

## FAQ:

### Does the mould have to be 3D milled?
> Answer:
1. No. It could be a torsion box (interlocking and skillfully joined) made on the laser or CNC, or a 3D mould.

### If the composite object is made without vacuum bag/compress/compact, is it acceptable?
> Answer:
1. You must prove you can use compression (two molds or vacuum bag) to remove extra resin. So if you just use wet layout you should make some test coupons showing you know how to do compaction. [See 2017 composite review video at 1h11m10s](https://vimeo.com/216868820#t=1h11m10s)
